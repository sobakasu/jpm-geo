# JpmGeo

Computes the bounding coordinates of all points on the surface of a sphere that have a great circle distance to the given point. This code was ported to ruby directly from http://janmatuschek.de/LatitudeLongitudeBoundingCoordinates, and is owned by Jan Philip Matuschek.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jpm-geo'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jpm-geo

## Usage

```
# lonlat is an object that responds to 'lon' and 'lat' methods
point = JpmGeo::Point.from_lonlat(lonlat) 
bounds = point.bounds(100) # km
p [bounds.min.lat, bounds.min.lon, bounds.max.lat, bounds.max.lon]
```
